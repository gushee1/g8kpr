This project serves as a backend server for a new rhythm game I am current developing in Unity. The core idea that inspired the creation of this game was to make a rhythm game where any song could be used, and a sequence of beats for the player to match could be generated on-demand. Though this process will likely not be very computationally intensive, I was interested in setting up a more complex backend system to support it, so I am moving the server that will generate beats from songs here, where I will be using gRPC to make calls from the game code. In addition to this, I plan to use an s3 instance to store audio files (songs) that will be used in the game.
